# Relentlessly Green

This is based on Katrina Owen's article [A Refactoring Workout: Relentlessly Green](http://www.sitepoint.com/refactoring-workout-relentlessly-green/).

The goal is to refactor in very small steps so that the tests are always green and if they go red, you can revert your changes with a single undo to get back to green.
